1) Async redirection
        When editing, adding, deleting items redirect using callbacks in order to redirect after the editing,saving or deleting is done
        Otherwise your page won`t be sync with DB as you will redirect before [editing,saving or deleting] is done
2) File handling/serving probelm
        Most of file problems are related to path
        be carefull: Absolute/Relative path
